# plastizyme
This GitHub repository contains a curated database of plastic-degrading enzymes, designed to support computational approaches for enzyme optimization.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to optimize plastic-degrading enzymes using computational methodologies. To achieve this, we:

    Curated existing databases of plastic-degrading enzymes through data mining.
    
    Generated biochemical descriptors for each enzyme using molecular modeling to gain deeper insights into enzymatic activity.
    
    Developed machine learning models to predict enzyme efficiency, aiding in the selection and enhancement of enzymes for sustainable plastic degradation.

By leveraging AI-driven predictions, this project aims to contribute to environmental sustainability by improving enzyme-based solutions for ocean plastic cleanup.

Repository Contents

    Curated enzyme dataset with molecular and biochemical annotations.
